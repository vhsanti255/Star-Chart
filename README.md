# Star-Chart
Inspired by a YouTube video, I decided to challenge myself to make this star chart.


NOTE: 

As a former teacher, I've always incorporated technology to help me with students' progresses within their subjects. So I decided to build this simple 'Skill Chart' using just HTML and CSS. I believe this interactive chart can be applicable to students, via learning online for example , to help students earn stars in their subjects... the stars can be used to earn a prize at the end of the week.
